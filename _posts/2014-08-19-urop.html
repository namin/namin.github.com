title: Letter to a Hacker Schooler about Undergraduate Research
---

Here are a few questions that might help you decide on which lab &
project to join next term.

* How excited are you about the project and its goals? Of course, you
  might not know enough to decide whether you'd want to work on this
  topic for years, but how eager are you to learn about the topic and
  contribute to the project?

* How do you feel about the team? Is there anyone apart from the
  professor who will be involved with your particular project? When I
  was doing research as an undergraduate, I found that I was most
  productive and fulfilled when there was one additional person
  (graduate student or postdoc) closely involved. Professors are
  typically very busy, so it's nice to have another person that can give
  you feedback on work-in-progress or just brainstorm more often.
  Ideally, this additional person would act as a closer mentor, from
  which you can learn quite a lot. Also, if you end up writing up your
  research for publication, it's much more fun to have an extra person
  involved -- even if you're the lead author, they can really help you
  get started with outlining the paper and such.

* Is the project a good mix of practice and theory? Is the project
  'ripe' for you to get involved? Are there some milestones or clear
  steps towards progress? Any opportunities for some 'quick' or 'instant
  gratification'? Can you make a small dent while also working towards
  the 'big' picture? Beware of purely practical projects where you'll
  essentially be 'just' a software dev. Try to find a project where
  there is also a more conceptual, research component. At the other
  extreme, also beware of some project with a lofty goal but no idea on
  how to approach it to make small-step progress towards it (if you're
  the only person involved in the project, you can easily feel blocked
  because you don't know what you can concretely do). As an
  undergraduate, I enjoyed projects where I could do some coding, while
  pursuing a research question (e.g. making sense of some biological
  data, or coming up with some effective algorithm for some problem) at
  the same time.

Regarding your specific questions:

> How do you know that you were with people asking the right big questions, and that these questions would interest you in the future?

The answer (for me) is: you don't know. Often as you learn more about
a research field, your perspective changes from outsider to insider.
From the outside, things might look more intriguing, from the inside,
you get to have a more nuanced (and when things go well, deeper)
appreciation.

Don't think that whatever project you do now will define your research
of years to come. Instead, take it as an opportunity to:

* discover what research is like, and whether you'd like to do a PhD.
  One caveat though: you might not get a "full" taste of what the
  experience is like, because undergraduate projects are usually more
  like "internships": you usually have a well-defined project with clear
  milestones (which is good in many ways). This feels very different
  from being a "full-time employee" where you often need to set your own
  goals -- and where finding your project is also part of the challenge.
  
* boost up your grad school application by demonstrating that you've
  successfully carried out some research, as you mention. at this stage,
  schools will like any research experience you might have, and they
  will understand that it doesn't necessarily defined the topic you'll
  choose in grad school.
